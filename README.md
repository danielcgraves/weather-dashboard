# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This project was created as part of the University of Utah Coding Bootcamp.

In this module of the curriculum we learned how to fetch server-side API's. This project demonstrates my ability to create functional weather application fetching from the API "open weather map." I created a functional search bar which pulled information from the server and displayed it onto the webpage.
